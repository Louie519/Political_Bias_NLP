0,"Let her keep showing her true colors, but do swing voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania care enough? Republicans must expand their attacks on her lunatic crypto tax by saying she already supports the Biden Administration's tax on mortgages for borrowers with good credit to support lower interests rates for sub prime borrowers which went into effect in 2023. That hurts the middle class. Republicans must attack on this issue now or Skamala will brainwash voters into believing she'll help the middle class.",right
1,"She doesn‚Äôt know basic economics yet 45-50% of people will be voting for her. If she somehow wins the election then I will lose faith in humanity, I feel bad for the people who are completely brainwashed however the number should not be this high. I don‚Äôt give a damn if you don‚Äôt like Trump, you got 4yrs of him and should be intelligent enough to realize he did a reasonable job and kept the world out of wars",right
2,"I'm going to present a different point of view on this. Let's say that she wins and America becomes the Socialist country that Venezuela is. (or was). 4 years form now NO ONE will vote for a Democrat again. Matter of fact, I'm going to say that the Republicans will take the House and Senate in the midterms. The reason that I'm saying this is that we are headed for an economic disaster that I'm not sure that either candidate can fix, because our debt is too large to control, and no one is working on fixing the issue. Give it a few years and our entire economy will implode because of the debt, regardless of who is in the White House. Most people don't realize all of the factors that are about to tank our economy. 1 of those major issues is the amount of business real estate that the banks are about to eat the cost of. $1.2 Trillion worth of office buildings are vacant. Banks will fail over this. The government will use more money to shore up those banks, adding to our collapse. It's only a matter of time at this point and I'd rather not see Trump get handed a broken economy that he can't fix. Let cackles take the fall, and then never vote Democrat again. BTW, if you think that either candidate can make real prices go back to where they were 4 years ago, I've got a bridge across the Saharan Ocean that I'll sell you. I'm in my 50's and prices have only ever gone up in my lifetime, never far enough down to make a real dent in spending. Wages are up. Prices are up, and they aren't coming down. Sorry to burst your bubble. Get use to the new normal. The only thing that might see a real decrease is home prices and business building prices, but that's due to the real estate bubble bursting. Roman from the Epoch Times detailed how companies are snapping up office buildings for 1/4 of their original value, or less. Other than that I just don't see how anything else is going to come down in price when real wages are going up.",right
3,"Kamala Harris is an existential threat to America. We can no longer treat this as a competition of ideas, because if we lose we don't have four years to regroup and try again.¬†


We have to stop soft-playing it as a battle of hearts and minds because democracy is fickle and unpredictable. We need a reliable and predictable system to consistently elect conservatives.


What they're doing in Georgia should be a blueprint for all red and swing states. Without it, we'll all be in reeducation camps by 2028",right
4,"&gt;Study: Harris Economic Agenda Could Add $2T to Deficit:

Study is a bit premature. We've yet to get to the main course.

This is the first day we've actually heard Harri$ start talking about any of her Candy Store Giveaways - as she did today for the babies and mad Monopoly money for home buyers.

Wait till she starts talking about servicing 10's of Millions of non-Americans (Illegals aliens) as well as her zany medical and green energy ideas.  Those Trillions will multiply very quickly.",right

Virginia Attorney General Miyares just said: What did they find when the Administration cleaned up Virginia‚Äôs voter rolls?
 
Nearly 80,000 deceased and voters
Over 6,300 non-citizens!

Virginia Attorney General said in a post on X on Wednesday that 6,303 ‚Äúnon-citizens‚Äù had been removed from voter rolls under Youngkin, in response to news about the executive order. Chloe Smith, a spokesperson for Miyares, said ‚Äúnon-citizen‚Äù is defined as a ‚Äúliving individual who does not have citizenship in the United States of America.‚Äù",right
6,"All the major news media corporations based in New York are supporting her with heavily biased reporting in favor of Skamala. They refuse to cover Trump rallies, interviews, town halls so swing voters don't get to hear the truth. That said, how any swing voters still exist is beyond belief, everyone witn half a brain knows the candidates, basically for the last 4 years and knows who they'll vote for. This election will be about voter turnout and how far Devilcrats will lie, cheat, steal, defraud, kill to win. So Republicans must also use ballot harvesting to win, what's the RNC waiting for.",right
7,"That's not a bad look at what immediate total confiscation would look like.

...which is why the government won't do it that way.

They'll ban a type of gun here, a type of ammunition there, imports from certain countries here, ownership by people who take certain medications there, and a ownership by a class of people who have been accused (not convicted) of certain crimes over there.  The Federal government will coerce banks into de-banking gun stores and ammunition dealers, and credit card companies will stop doing business with them on the same basis.  Psychiatrists will be told they'll be held liable if one of their patients commits a gun crime, unless they report that patient to the Federal Government to have their guns taken away.

Think that's far fetched?  ALL of that has already been done, in the last decade and a half.

Some states have been trying to push mandatory firearm insurance on gun owners, which would be a per-gun payment in case the firearm was used in a crime.  The idea here is to make it so expensive to *legally* own a firearm that people will give them up willingly - and if you don't pay the insurance, when you're found out (as you likely will eventually be), you'll go to prison.

In time they will force all the legal gun dealers out of business, and the manufacturers will only sell to the government.

Eventually few enough people will legally own guns that it will be possible to do a mandatory buyback, as was done in Venezuela, followed by forced confiscation on any holdouts.

THAT's what confiscation would really look like.",right
8,"I hope he completely nails Walz, Vance has been great in interviews. At first I was a bit skeptical of the pick but he‚Äôs grown on me a lot. I think Walz will do alot of back tracking and Vance seems like the type who will prepare extremely well. As long as he tricks him up on policy and defends not having Project2025 as part of him and Trumps agenda and can convince voters of that he wins.",right
9,"&gt;That she does not is because she is lazy and has a terrible work ethic.

That is a correct statement.

But the other, and bigger reason, is that she also has no intention to do a number of her promises,,,she's LYING!

For example, she says she's now going to solve the Border problem.  The way she plans to ""solve"" it, is to re-introduce that phony scam bill that Biden tried a few months ago.  The bill that would legalize the border invasion!!!!  Total fraud/liar.",right
10,"So let me get this straight the attempts to silence Trump and erase and restrict him from the public square resulted in exactly that happening. And now they are pissed off because the very thing they did is preventing them from using it again and they are now trying to blame Musk üôÑ


Anyone know where they are going to curve this to yet. 
My guess is they are going to say trumps account while president is official records and blame Trump and Musk of NARA violations.",right
11,"This is how the left treats you when you won't include the word 'joy' in every line you speak about Kamala.

This is how the left treats you when your show about dinosaurs is actually a show about dinosaurs, instead of being ""Dinosaurs"" on the box and a giant Kamala campaign ad on the inside.

12,"Trump's [crowd in North Carolina](https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1824505405470392420) yesterday.

13,"From the article: 

Graham said, ‚ÄúYeah. I don‚Äôt think ‚Äî I don‚Äôt look at Vice President Kamala Harris as a lunatic. I look at her as the most liberal person to ever be nominated for president in the history of the United States. She‚Äôs going to the Soviet Union playbook to lower prices called price control. She wants to eliminate private health care. She‚Äôs for reparations. She‚Äôs against fracking. She‚Äôs with the Green New Deal on and on. So, I would make it about policy. A nightmare for Harris is to defend her policy choices.‚Äù

Welker asked, ‚ÄúDo you think former President Trump should stop talking about Vice President Harris‚Äôs race and intelligence?‚Äù

Graham said, ‚ÄúPresident Trump can win this election. His policies are good for America. If you have a policy debate, he wins. Donald Trump the provocateur, the showman, may not win this election.‚Äù

So really he is saying what a lot of people are saying. Trump wins this on policy easily no need to make it about anything else.",right
14,"Just so you all know, there is a colorable legal basis for her to do that.  And I‚Äôm telling you this to show that what she said is even more scary than you think.

Under the Bayh Dole Act, the government has the right to ‚Äúmarch in‚Äù and license on ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù terms, a patent that has not achieved ‚Äúpractical application‚Äù (available to the public in ‚Äúreasonable terms‚Äù) by the owner.  See 35 USC 201(f), and 203.  The government has NEVER exercised this power in the entire 45 years that this has been law.

What Commie-la Harris is planning to do is massively reinterpret what ‚Äúreasonable terms‚Äù means using the power of government administrative agencies.  In 2019, this could have easily been weaponized because courts deferred to agency interpretation of rules under the Chevron doctrine.  Of course - now that was recently reversed by SCOTUS, so it will probably be harder. 

Anyways - what I‚Äôm trying to get at is that what she said was not just some one off rant - it was and is part of a very serious plan",right
15,"Outrageous? Hardly. The EU is controlled by people who either hate the US experiment on general principle or by people whose ancestors wanted their colonies back, and feel getting them back is their birthright. 

If we manage to get through this era of Marxist permeation of society, we're gonna have to really rethink our ""close"" ties with nations who don't hold the same values on freedom that we do. No country in the EU has laws to limit *government* like we do. What freedoms Europeans have enjoyed really are just what the elite are willing to suffer to keep the populace docile.",right
16,"&gt;Biden said [of VP Kamala Harris] ‚ÄúLittle black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today, today just maybe, they‚Äôre seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of president and vice presidents‚Äù 
&gt;  
&gt;**Now**, Harris has supplanted Biden atop the Democrats‚Äô 2024 ticket after the president‚Äôs stunning withdrawal. Notably, however, Biden‚Äôs endorsement of Harris last month **made no mention of her race, ethnicity, or gender**.  
  
THIS is the crux of the issue. Woke ideology is fundamentally performative. It's switched on when it's convenient and switched off when it's inconvenient. It's *anti-*equality. Wokeness serves Globalist power brokers alone.",right
17,"What astonishes me the most is how people persist in this discredited notion of price controls. This clearly demonstrates her lack of knowledge. At best, it is merely electoral propaganda, but even in this context, the need to resort to such statements for votes is just sad.

It‚Äôs akin to claiming the Earth is flat to garner the support of flat-earthers, although flat-earthism remains a more respectable idea than anything rooted in a socialist agenda.",right
18,"If it makes you feel better, she's not actually going to do it (in any significant way). If anything is even done, the law / action will be written in such a way that it will either be easily overturned or will have a 1000 step process and a list of onerous requirements to qualify. They will then trot out the four or five people that ran the obstacle course and claim victory.

Just a way to get gullible people to vote for her.",right
19,"I totally get your position. IMO it's important to note Harris' 2A stance, that being how she's one of the biggest gun-grabbers in American history, even to a point that made Biden uncomfortable. She vowed to abuse executive powers to force restrictions and bans within her first 100 days in office, and she's shown vocal support for forced gun 'buybacks'. I don't know how safe our rights are with the GOP, but if you ask me, you have **no** rights without the ability to defend them.",right
20,"In reality, I‚Äôm likely voting for Kennedy. But if I had to choose, I‚Äôd pick Trump. Not because I like Trump, I don‚Äôt. He is way too populist. But Harris (and Walz) have a clear and direct history of acting against personal liberty. Full stop. Their records scare me, their policy proposals scare me. 

But what is scariest is this weird media blitz. They seem an entirely manufactured campaign. Kamala went from the VP with the lowest approval scores, to the second coming of god over night. Her record was scrubbed in the media. She‚Äôs a brand, not someone who will have real responsibilities as president. Same with the Walz midwestern dad persona. It feels very dystopian and it‚Äôs quite scary to me.",right
21,"I never liked trump, still don't. His original selling point was ""I know all of these politicians are corrupt, hell I've personally bribed many of them."" So to me, his platform has been to cut the middle man out of corruption and just have the rich guys directly run the state instead of bribing politicians to do it.

That said, David smith had a guest that mentioned a few damning facts. The shooter had no clear motive, let's remember that. He was in a blackrock commercial last year. A few days before the assassination attempt, GPS data from his phone showed he was in Washington. Trump's regular SS team was with Jill Biden that day, local no bodies were placed to watch him. Finally, trump never had a counter sniper team until that day.

If it had been ordered by the dems, it would be pretty smart to have the guys in position to stop your assassin already on your pay roll.

And don't forget, they said the roof was too steep to have guards up there. After Crook was shot, his lifeless corpse remained on the roof. If a dead body can keep from falling off, I'm quite certain a trained soldier can do it.

Still, as bad as all this looks, I don't think the weight of the evidence matches the weight of the claim. If I knew of any confirmed government assassinations to compare this situation to, then I could give you a more confident answer. I will say that I personally can't write off anyone who believes it was a conspiracy. It's hard to say it definitely was, but it's hard to say it definitely wasnt.",right
22,"I just don't believe this 2A to stop tyranny thing anymore.

Let's take a look at 2 more recent American examples. Covid and the 2020 election. In both these situations I saw hundreds, if not thousands of posts online about how it was straight up **tyranny**.

So for the people that believed tyranny happened and also owned guns, where the fuck were you? If you aren't going to use guns when your country is, in your mind, literally stolen from you, when are you going to use them?

The next tyranny I suppose. But actually, that might happen on a Tuesday and that's a bad day for you. So the one after that I guess.",right
